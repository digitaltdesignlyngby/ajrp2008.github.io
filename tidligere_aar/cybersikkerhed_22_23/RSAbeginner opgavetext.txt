Unfortunately the developer published p and q and e 
and not n and e which he should have done 
as the company public key

These were:

p=111351602227707581067416344643048751626960926253551879945433066776126511936461
q=67722700071961988029846370299408511833514117774646239226239805715004968536019
e=65537

The attacker sniffed the transmitted integer and that was:

cipher=3180216847896822642607790534988843792574569579226923103980

Can you decode this and find the flag?
